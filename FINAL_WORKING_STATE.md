# 🎉 zkTender Multi-Instance System - FINAL WORKING STATE

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

### 🐛 Final Bug Fixed
- **Issue**: Final evaluations page showing "Results Not Yet Available" 
- **Root Cause**: Database query error due to missing `reveal_timestamp` column in `proposal_commitments` table
- **Solution**: Updated query to use LEFT JOIN with `revealed_proposals` table to determine reveal status
- **Result**: ✅ Final evaluations now working and displaying complete results
