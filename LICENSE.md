📜 zkTender Fair Use License (Draft v0.1)

This license governs use of the zkTender software, platform, and materials.
🔓 1. Personal and Civic Use — Free
You are free to:

Use zkTender for personal, educational, or grassroots civic purposes
Modify or remix the code for non-commercial, non-institutional use
Share it with others under the same terms
✅ You’re a student? Activist collective? Civic hacker?
Go wild — it’s yours.

If you improve the code and people love your version, we invite you to officially join the project.
You’ll earn a cut when institutions choose your fork — and help grow a public tech ecosystem that rewards creators.


🏛 2. Institutional Use — Paid or Permission-Based
If you represent a:

Government agency
Municipality
NGO with an operational budget over €100k
Corporation or funded research group
Then you must:

Contact the creator for a use license or partnership agreement
Support the continued development through funding, licensing, or formal collaboration
You cannot embed or deploy zkTender in your systems without explicit permission.
⚠️ 3. No Resale, No Rebranding
You may not sell, license, or white-label zkTender or its components without written agreement.
You must credit the project and its creator in public-facing use.
🛡 4. No Warranty
This project is provided “as-is.” Use at your own risk.
The creator is not liable for damages, misuses, or bad decisions made with it.
